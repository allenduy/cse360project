CSE 360 Project
=============
This is the repo for this project.

9/12 - I uploaded a small Direct2D program that draws 10 random circles to the screen.  I have a lot of comments throughout the code, so it should give you guys a basic idea of how to work with directX.  Feel free to modify it to start the sudoku game.  

9/29 - I uploaded a GUI for the sudoku game.  None of the buttons work; however, a 2d array of ints can be printed to the screen, so we're most of the way there.  Allen has been working on some of the game board and cell classes, so once those are done, and I add in user input, the base game will be complete.
