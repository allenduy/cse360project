CSE 360 Project
=============
This is the repo for this project.

9/12 - I uploaded a small Direct2D program that draws 10 random circles to the screen.  I have a lot of comments throughout the code, so it should give you guys a basic idea of how to work with directX.  Feel free to modify it to start the sudoku game.
